Hello everyone! My name is Shae and I'm a 1st year MS (Health Data Science) student. I am a medical student from Australia where I completed the first year of my MD and then decided to take a leave of absence to improve my programming and computational biology skills. I also started a small startup that makes virtual AI patients for medical students to practice their history-taking and diagnosis skills. I am very excited to learn how to put my prior python syntax knowledge into practice and improve my applied programming skills with this course.
My completed assignment one is in this repository at this link: https://github.com/shaemclaughlin/datasci_223/tree/main/exercises/1-foundations
